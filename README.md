# Tic-Tac-Toe with Markov Chain Learning

This project implements the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using reinforcement learning. An AI (O) learns to play against the Minimax algorithm (X), using a Markov chain for decision-making.

## Features

*   Markov chain-based AI learning to play Tic-Tac-Toe.
*   Minimax algorithm acting as a "perfect" opponent.
*   Graphical user interface (GUI) with Tkinter to visualize the learning process and gameplay.
*   Option to choose between playing against Markov or Minimax after training.
*   Real-time game and training statistics displayed in the GUI.

## Usage

*   Click the "Train AI (AI vs AI)" button to start training the Markov AI.
*   Click the "Stop Training" button to stop the training.
*   Choose "Play with Markov AI" or "Play with Minimax AI" in the "Actions" menu to play against the selected AI.
*   Click on the cells of the game board to make a move.
